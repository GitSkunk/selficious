===================

This is a _quick n' dirty_ app written _very_ quickly to backup my delicious
bookmarks and manage my future ones.

More details, soon -I hope :)

INSTALLATION
============

Super EASY!

0) Get your copy of tornado at: 
https://github.com/facebook/tornado 
And copy the folder tornado/todnado into the project's directory.

1) Copy app.sample.yaml to app.yaml 
2) Copy settings.sample.py to settings.py

3) Edit the file app.yaml:
Change the application name

Example:

    application: mybookmarks (the one you reserved on appengine)
    version: 1
    runtime: python
    api_version: 1


4) Edit settings.py with your site title (Example: My bookmarks extraordinaires!)

ATTENTION
=========

This app was made in a  hurry for fun. There are probably things to imporve
and/or fix. Your feedback is welcome!
